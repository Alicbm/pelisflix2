Hello Again! 

Welcome to my repository, this time I have the opportunity to present you the improved version of one of my previous projects, **[Pelisflix](alicbm.github.io/pelisflix/ "Pelisflix")**. This app has previous features like the main section with different types of movies where we have options like **Trending**, **Now Playing**, **Top Rated** and **Popular** for the different movies. We have a database with a large number of movies (more than 800,000 movies), we can do this search either by filtering the movies by each category or by typing the name of the movie we want to find in the input search.

On the other hand, in the description path there are news, now we have the option to see the trailer of the film that we look for; but that's not all, there is an option to see the reviews written by other people. Also, the app owns the above options in this path like movie overview, movie release date, popularity, related movies and main cast of the movie.

However, the new functionalities are not the main reason why the new version of this app was made, as I reviewed the app some time ago and saw various issues with it. The main problem was the code, there were many functions with the same functionality, the process was not automated and visually the code was horrible. Another reason was the way I passed the data through the different components, useContext is not the best option for this, so I decided to use the redux toolkit for this task.

> This app uses the [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage "LocalStorage")  tool, which is useful for data persistence, and in this way we can navigate the page without problems. If you want to know more about this tool you can do click on the prevous link.
